## What is a Code Kata?

A Kata is an exercise in martial arts. A code Kata is an exercise in programming which helps hone your skills through practice and repetition. You can find out more about code Katas in general [here](http://codekata.pragprog.com).

A Kata can be structured as a unit test that fails one or more assertions. The learner is expected to add enough code such that the test passes.
